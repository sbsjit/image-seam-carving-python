# Seam Carving Using Dynamic Programming <img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/study_plan/dynamic-programming/cover.png" width="50" height="50"> 

This is a small project to understand the concept of Image Seam Carving and how it can be done with the help of Dynamic Programming using Python environment and tools.

To run the carver file:
 For resizing WIDTH: python carver.py column 0.5 ./test-images/img_lights.jpeg ./cropped-images/img_lights_carved3.jpg ./energy-map-images/img_lights_energy_map3.jpg

 For resizing HEIGHT: python carver.py row 0.8 ./test-images/img_lights.jpeg ./cropped-images/img_lights_carved.jpg ./energy-map-images/img_lights_energy_map.jpg
